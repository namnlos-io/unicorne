A single-piece corne keyboard mod and case.

Unicorne is a Corne keyboard coupled with a hinged unibody case based on ["Corne Travel Case"](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4921564) by [denniskempin](https://www.thingiverse.com/denniskempin).

The Corne inside is using a single Pro Micro on the left side and a single display on the right side, the sides are part of the same matrix connected through the center hinge instead of the traditional setup with two Pro Micro's and a TRRS cable connecting the halves.
